# search for a word in a folder

You can modify the folder_path variable to specify the directory containing your text files, and modify the desired_words list to include the words you want to search for. The script will iterate through each text file in the folder and check if any of the desired words are present in the file contents. If a desired word is found, the script will print a message indicating which word was found in which file.
